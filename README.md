# SENET-Board-Game
Senet is an ancient Egyptian board game that was popular during the New Kingdom period, around 1550-1077 BCE. The game consists of a board with 30 squares arranged in three rows of ten, and each player has a set of pieces that are moved along the board according to dice rolls.

The objective of the game is to move all of your pieces off the board before your opponent does. The game also involves strategy and tactics, as players can block their opponent's moves and capture their pieces.

Senet was not only a game, but also had religious and symbolic significance in ancient Egyptian culture. It was believed to represent the journey of the soul through the afterlife, and some of the squares on the board were associated with specific deities and concepts.

The rules of Senet are not completely known, as they were not written down until much later in history. However, modern interpretations of the game have been developed based on archaeological evidence and ancient texts.

Despite its ancient origins, Senet has remained popular to this day, with many modern versions of the game available for purchase. It continues to be a fascinating and challenging game, offering a glimpse into the ancient world and the culture of the Egyptians who played it.
